# Chapter 15: Graphics with Canvas
* The `<canvas>` element requires at least its `width` and `height` attributes to be set in order to indicate the size of the drawing to be created. Any content appearing between the opening and closing tags is fallback data that is displayed only if the `<canvas>` element isn't supported.
* Images created on a `<canvas>` element can be exported using the `toDataURL()` method. This method accepts a single argument, the MIME type format of the image to produce, and is applicable regardless of the context used to create the image.
