* The first character of identifiers could be a dollar sign ($). Letters in an identifier may include extended ASCII or Unicode letter characters such as À and Æ.
* There are five simple data types (primitive types): Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, and String. There is also one complex data type called Object.
* `typeof null` will return `object`, as the special value `null` is considered to be an empty object reference.
* Referring undeclared variable will cause an error. Only `typeof` can be called on an undeclared variable. The `typeof` operator will both return `undefined` when called on uninitialized or undeclared variable.
